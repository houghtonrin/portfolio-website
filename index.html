        <p>Hello, it's nice to meet you! One day I hope to be a Lawyer specializing in Computer Science. I am a student at the Northern Utah Academy of Math Engineering and Science, also known as NUAMES. I am also an early college student at Weber State University and am anticipating graduating in the Spring of 2025 with an Associates of Applied Science in Computer Science and an Associates of Science in General Studies. I love seeing where technology and society meet and studying how technology has to adapt to continue to support humanity.</p>
