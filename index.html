                <p>One day I hope to be a Lawyer specializing in Computer Science. I am a student at the Northern Utah Academy of Math Engineering and Science, also known as NUAMES. I am an early college student at Weber State University and am anticipating graduating in the Spring of 2025 with an Associates in Computer Science and an Assocites in General Studies. I love seeing where technology and society meet and studying how technology has to adapt to continue to support humanity.</p>
                <p>My favorite subjects in school are math and computer science. I find that they help me to refocus my mind. I have also always enjoyed debates and mock trial. When I was deciding on my career plans and future majors, I wrested between these two subjects. Eventually I learned that I could be a lawyer specializing in computer science and computer related problems.</p>
                <p>In my free time I like to spend time volunteering with Layton City Youth Council, Studying for my upcoming exams, Hiking on local trails, and tutoring students at Mathnasium. I also enjoy baking and sewing. My favorite things to bake are cinnamon rolls and bread. I enjoy studying historical sewing techniques and creating my own garments.</p>
                <p>As I work through my final year of high school I like to dream about where I will be in the coming years. Whether my life follows my current plan or not, I am sure that I will achieve great things. Join me in my upcoming adventures!</p>
